     * their defaults), particles, HUD and music, and resets the scene background, fog and the
     * sun / ambient light to the engine defaults. Filters, render
     * mode, resolution, quality, volumes and the camera rig carry over; pass `camera` to
     * switch the preset (applied before `setup()`, so `ctx.camera` is already the new one).
     * Nothing advances while loading, and input made while loading is dropped (data sent with
