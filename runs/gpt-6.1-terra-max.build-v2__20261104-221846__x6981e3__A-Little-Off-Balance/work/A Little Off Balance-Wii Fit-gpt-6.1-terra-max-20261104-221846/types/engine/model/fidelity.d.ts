/**
 * Fidelity scoring (docs/assets/importing.md *Scores*): how faithfully one set of coloured
 * triangles (a translation: an import's ModelDef, later an agent's trace) draws another (its
 * source). Both are drawn by the software rasterizer the model sheets use, at 4 yaws, at game
 * scale (Riftlight's camera at the level zoom) and close up. Per view: the silhouette IoU
 * (pixels either covers, the background left out) and the mean OKLab distance between their
 * flat colours where both cover a pixel; overall, the bounds delta. Pure, so tools and tests
 * share it.
 *
 *   const score = scoreFidelity(imported.source, modelTriangles(def));
 *   score.iou       // the worst game-scale view; an import below 0.98 is an importer bug
