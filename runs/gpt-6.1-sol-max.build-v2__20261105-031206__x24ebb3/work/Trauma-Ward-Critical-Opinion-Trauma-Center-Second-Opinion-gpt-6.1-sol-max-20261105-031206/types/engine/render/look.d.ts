/**
 * Looks: which filters run on which part of the picture.
 *
 * A frame has two kinds of things in it: **actors** (characters and objects: the hero,
 * monsters, townsfolk, loot, chests; anything a game tags with `setLookLayer(obj, 'actors')`)
 * and the **environment** (everything else: floors, walls, buildings, trees). A `Look` gives
 * each of them its own source and filter stack, and then runs a third stack over the whole
 * composed frame:
 *
 *   actors      → pixel art (or clean) + actor filters   ─┐
 *                                                         ├─ composed by depth ─▶ scene filters ─▶ screen
 *   environment → pixel art (or clean) + world filters   ─┘
 *
 * So a clean, full-resolution world with pixel-art characters is
 * `{ actors: { pixel: crisp }, environment: { pixel: null } }`. When both layers are the
 * same (the default: pixel art everywhere, filters on the whole scene) the renderer draws
 * the scene once, exactly as before; only a look that differs per layer pays for a second
 * scene pass. Filter parameters are uniforms, so moving a slider never rebuilds a shader.
 *
 * Everything here is plain data (unit-tested in `look.test.ts`): the renderer turns a look
 * into a node graph (`PixelRenderer.setLook`).
