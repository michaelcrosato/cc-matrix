/**
 * Recordings of play (docs/DOCTRINE.md, principle 1). From a level's start, its seed and the
 * input of every frame decide everything that happens in it, so a recording is just those: the
 * engine keeps one for the level that is running (`engine.recording()`), `engine.replay()` plays
 * one back frame for frame, and `engine.fingerprint()` hashes the state, so two runs that
 * should match can be compared. A recorded bug is a file; replayed, it is a test.
 *
 *   const rec = engine.recording();                          // JSON: seed, game, frames
 *   await engine.replay(rec, () => engine.loadGame(new MyGame()));
 *   engine.fingerprint() === fingerprintAtTheEnd;            // the same game, frame for frame
 *
 * What a replay can't reproduce: anything a game takes from outside `ctx.input` and its frames
 * (DOM events it listens to itself, a model that finishes loading mid-play, the wall clock, a
 * camera left turned by the level before). Data a game must take from the page (a save in
 * storage, a text field) goes through `ctx.input.send()`, which the recording keeps.
 * docs/engine/determinism.md *Recording and replay*.
