/**
 * Save-states (docs/DOCTRINE.md, principle 1): a running level as data, taken between two
 * frames (`engine.snapshot()`) and put back at once (`engine.restore(snap)`), so restoring a
 * moment no longer means replaying everything before it. The engine keeps its own part (game
 * time, the clock, `ctx.random`, the physics world, the camera, the shake, input still waiting)
 * and the game its own (`Game.snapshot` / `Game.restore`).
 *
 *   const snap = await engine.snapshot();         // JSON: keep it, attach it to a bug
 *   engine.step(300);                             // ...play on
 *   await engine.restore(snap);                   // back to that moment (the same game, loaded)
 *
 * A restore starts the level's recording again from the snapshot (`Recording.from`), so a
 * recording made after one replays with `replay(rec, start)`: it loads the game, restores the
 * snapshot, then plays the frames. docs/engine/determinism.md *Save-states*.
