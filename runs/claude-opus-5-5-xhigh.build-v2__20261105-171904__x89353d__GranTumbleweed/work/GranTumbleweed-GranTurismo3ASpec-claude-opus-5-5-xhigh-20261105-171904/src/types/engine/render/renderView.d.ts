/**
 * A second camera's view rendered into a texture: security monitors, a minimap, a scope, the
 * far side of a portal. Each frame (or every few) the view draws the scene from its own camera
 * into a small render target before the main frame renders; any material can show
 * `view.texture`, and the pixel pass then pixelates the screen like everything else.
 *
 *   const cam = new RenderView({ size: [160, 90], fov: 60, every: 2 });
 *   cam.camera.position.set(4, 3, 4); cam.camera.lookAt(0, 1, 0);
 *   const stop = cam.attach(engine.renderer, scene);   // renders before each frame
 *   screen.material = cam.screenMaterial();             // and screen.layers.set(SCREEN_LAYER)
 *
 * Screens (and mirrors) go on `SCREEN_LAYER`: the main camera always sees it, views never
 * do, so a texture is never sampled while it is being drawn (and views don't recurse).
