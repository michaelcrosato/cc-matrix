/**
 * A flat mirror: before each frame a camera reflected in the mirror's plane draws the scene
 * into a texture at the art resolution, and the glass shows it at each pixel's screen position
 * (mirrored left to right), so the reflection lines up from wherever the camera looks. An
 * oblique near plane (Lengyel) on that camera cuts away everything behind the glass; it works
 * for orthographic cameras (the iso view) as well as perspective ones.
 *
 *   const mirror = new Mirror({ size: [8, 3] });
 *   mirror.mesh.position.set(0, 1.8, -6.9);              // the glass faces its local +z
 *   scene.add(mirror.mesh);
 *   const stop = mirror.attach(engine.renderer, scene);  // renders before each frame
 *
 * The glass is on `SCREEN_LAYER`, so neither it nor other screens appear in the reflection.
