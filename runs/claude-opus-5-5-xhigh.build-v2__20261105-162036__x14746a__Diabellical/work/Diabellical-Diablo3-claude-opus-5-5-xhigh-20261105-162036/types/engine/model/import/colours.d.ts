/**
 * Palette mapping for imports (docs/assets/importing.md *Colours*): source colours → a few palette
 * slots, each bound to a PALETTE entry. It works on a whole model (or a whole pack), never one
 * colour at a time, because a nearest match per colour turns pale wood into `white`:
 *
 * 1. **Cluster** the per-face colours in OKLab into 2–6 clusters, hue weighted up and lightness
 *    down (baked shading varies lightness most): near duplicates and the steps of a baked
 *    gradient join; colours further apart than the palette's closest pair stay apart.
 * 2. **Assign** clusters to entries, biggest area first, at the cost
 *    `ΔL² + (0.7·ΔC)² + (2.5·ΔH)²`, where ΔH is the hue chord `2·√(C₁C₂)·sin(Δh/2)` (it shrinks
 *    to nothing for greys, whose hue means nothing), plus a penalty when a grey and a colour swap
 *    and another for an entry a bigger cluster already took. Then move clusters one at a time
 *    while that lowers the total, so a big pale wood steps aside to `sand` when that lets a small
 *    pink cushion keep `orange` to itself.
 * 3. **Keep lightness order** within a hue family: a light and a dark wood stay light and dark.
 *
 * Slots take the material's name when it means something (`wood`, `metalDark`), else `c1`,
 * `c2`… by area. Deterministic: the same colours give the same slots, in any order.
