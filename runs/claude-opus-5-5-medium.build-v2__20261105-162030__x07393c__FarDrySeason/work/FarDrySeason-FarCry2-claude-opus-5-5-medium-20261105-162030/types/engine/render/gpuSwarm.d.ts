/**
 * A swarm simulated on the GPU: every particle's position and velocity live in GPU storage
 * buffers, and a TSL compute shader moves them all each frame (pulled toward an attractor,
 * swirled round it, stirred by a noise flow, bounced off a floor). The CPU never touches a
 * particle; drawing is one instanced sprite draw reading the same buffer.
 *
 *   const swarm = new GpuSwarm({ count: 32768, center: [0, 2, 0] });
 *   scene.add(swarm.mesh);
 *   swarm.update(engine.renderer, dt);            // per frame (nothing headless)
 *   swarm.attractor.value.set(x, y, z);           // uniforms: change them live
