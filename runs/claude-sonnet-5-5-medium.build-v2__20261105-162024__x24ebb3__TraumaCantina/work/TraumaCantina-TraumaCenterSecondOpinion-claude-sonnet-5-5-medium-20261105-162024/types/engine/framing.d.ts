/**
 * Pure layout math for pixel-perfect presentation. No DOM, no three.js: unit-tested.
 *
 * The canvas backing store is sized to `art × scale` device pixels with an integer
 * `scale`, and the scene renders at exactly the art resolution (pixelSize = scale). Every
 * art pixel therefore covers an integer block of device pixels, and the canvas is centered
 * inside the viewport. Fixed/adaptive framing letterboxes; fill framing crops only the
 * excess device pixels at the edges of the last art pixel.
 *
 * Three aspect modes:
 * - `fixed`: the art resolution is exactly `internal` (16:9); other screen shapes letterbox.
 * - `adaptive`: the art *height* stays `internal.height` and the art width follows the
 *   screen's aspect (clamped to ADAPTIVE_ASPECT), so phones in portrait or landscape and
 *   odd window shapes fill the screen. Still integer-scaled. On a 16:9 screen it is
 *   identical to `fixed`.
 * - `fill`: the art width and height follow the viewport at the nearest integer scale
 *   to `internal.height`. The canvas covers every edge without stretching art pixels.
