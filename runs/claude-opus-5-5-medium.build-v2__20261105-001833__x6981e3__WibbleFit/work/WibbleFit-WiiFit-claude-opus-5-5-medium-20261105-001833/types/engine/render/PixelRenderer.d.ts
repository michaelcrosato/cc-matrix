 * One WebGPURenderer, one RenderPipeline, two output nodes.
 *
 * Pixel mode:  toon/node scene → scene pass at the art resolution (nearest-filtered MRT:
 *              color + normal + depth) → art-resolution stage: depth/normal edges, output
 *              color transform, then every *art-pixel* filter (palettes, dither, colour
 *              grades…) into one art-sized target → ONE nearest-neighbour upscale to the
 *              canvas (an integer multiple of the art resolution) → *display* filters
 *              (scanlines, LCD grid, CRT…) at device resolution, only when there are any.
 * Raw mode:    the same scene/camera through a plain full-resolution `pass()` and the
 *              output color transform only; same pipeline, same canvas size, same
 *              framing. Only `outputNode` changes.
 *
 * So the per-fragment cost at device resolution is one texture read unless a display
 * filter is active; the edge detection (~10 reads) and palette searches run 1/scale² as
 * often as they used to.
 *
 * WebGPU only: without it (no `navigator.gpu`, no adapter, or three falling back to its WebGL 2
 * backend) the renderer refuses to start, saying so (`NO_WEBGPU`). There is no second
 * renderer, except that a lost GPU device (mobile browsers drop it after backgrounding or under
 * memory pressure) is replaced by a fresh renderer + pipeline on a fresh canvas (`recoveries`
 * counts them).
